Inspired by [Paul Graham's tweet](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1705152352288669779), I've started thinking about what are the most impressive companies to work for. Which are the new inventors, the ones that shape the future, or the ones that do a thing incredibly unique?

Of course you could still join FAANG companies, but there you won't have a high impact, or influence the product directly (if you're not some kind of George Hotz). 

I've made this list both as a appreciation for their current and future work, but also as (maybe) my dream jobs:

- [Replit](https://replit.com) - Revolutionizing the way people learn, teach, and work with code.
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com) - Pioneering AI research and development.
- [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/) - Building programmable memory for AI.
- [Replicate](https://replicate.com) - Running AI models from the world's most creative machine learning developers.
- [Airchat](https://www.getairchat.com/) - A better way for conversations on the internet.
- [Figma](https://figma.com) - Leading the charge in collaborative design and prototyping software.
